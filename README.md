# Titanic Classification Project

This project is part of my internship with CodeAlpha. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtained the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data and handled missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selected relevant features and created dummy variables for categorical features.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the data to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to find the best-performing model.
6. **Prediction**: Used the best model to make predictions on the test set.
7. **Submission**: Created a submission file in the required format for Kaggle.

## Files in This Repository
